I want you to act as a React code reviewer. 
I will provide the content of my React project files. 
Please check all of them for:

1. Missing or incorrect imports/exports.
2. Broken or misconfigured React Router routes.
3. Components that may crash or cause a blank screen.
4. Syntax errors or JSX mistakes.
5. Any potential issues in index.js or App.js that could prevent rendering.

Please respond with:
- A clear list of problems found, specifying the file and line if possible.
- Suggested fixes or code corrections.
- Notes about best practices to avoid similar issues.

Here are my files:

[text](src/App.js),[text](src/pages/Home.jsx),[text](src/index.js),[text](src/data/SpotsData.js),[text](src/components/Slider.jsx),[text](src/components/Header.jsx)
